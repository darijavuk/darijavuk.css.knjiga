        <h1>1. Markup languages</h1>
        <p>
            A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.
        </p>
        <h2>Types of markup languages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>- Presentational markup - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word).</li>
            <li>- Procedural markup - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX).</li>
            <li>- Descriptive (logical) markup - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML).</li>
        </ul>
