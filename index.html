        <h1><i>1. Markup languages</i></h1>
        <p>
            A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.
        </p>
        <h2>Types of markup languages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>- Presentational markup - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word).</li>
            <li>- Procedural markup - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX).</li>
            <li>- Descriptive (logical) markup - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><i>1.2. HTML</i></h2>
        <p>
            HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.
        </p>
        <h3><i>1.2.1. How the browser displays HTML</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1. The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree.</li>
            <li>2. The DOM tree is used to construct a render tree.</li>
            <li>3. A layout is generated from the render tree.</li>
            <li>4. The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout.</li>
        </ul>
